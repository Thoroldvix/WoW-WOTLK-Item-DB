# WoW-WOTLK-Item-DB

When searching for the list or datasets of BoE items I found out that it doesn't exists, all datasets that are out there contain all item info.

So i decided to clean up dataset which is provided by https://github.com/cmangos/wotlk-db.

I managed to shorten it from 48k rows to 18k. There are still some non-tradeable items in this dataset, but it's good enough for me. You can narrow it further if you want. 

I also changed original table structure and naming and also changed SQL dialect to Postgresql.

Dialect that is used in original script is MySQL.
